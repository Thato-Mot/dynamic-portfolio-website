## Updates üöÄ

### 2025 - Flask Integration and Python Backend

I have recently **integrated Python with Flask** to enhance the functionality of my portfolio. This update allows for dynamic content and the potential to add more interactive and data-driven features.

- **Flask Backend**: The website now uses **Flask** for serving dynamic routes and enabling the use of Python in handling backend processes.
- **Python Integration**: The integration of Python allows for more flexibility, including data processing, user authentication, and future expansions with APIs.
- **Routing**: The website now features Flask routing for pages like **About**, **Projects**, and **Contact**, making the site more scalable and interactive.
  
### Upcoming Features:

- **More Data-Driven Content**: With Python and Flask, I will be able to add more content that is dynamically generated, such as project data, achievements, and progress updates.
- **APIs**: Future plans include integrating external APIs to showcase projects and achievements that are tied to live data sources.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Theme Toggle**: Easily switch between **dark** and **light** themes for optimal viewing. (Press `T`)
- **Interactive Cursor Effect**: A custom **light flare cursor** effect that enhances user experience.
